        <h2>1. Choose Eco-Friendly Transportation</h2>
        <p>Reduce your carbon footprint by using trains, buses, or ridesharing instead of flights. Walking and cycling are also great eco-friendly options.</p>

        <h2>2. Pack Light</h2>
        <p>The more weight you carry, the more fuel is needed for transport. Pack only essentials and bring reusable items like water bottles and tote bags.</p>

        <h2>3. Stay in Eco-Friendly Accommodations</h2>
        <p>Choose lodges, guesthouses, or hotels with green certifications that use renewable energy and sustainable practices.</p>

        <h2>4. Reduce Plastic Waste</h2>
        <p>Avoid single-use plastics. Bring a reusable water bottle, cloth shopping bag, and eco-friendly utensils.</p>

        <h2>5. Eat Local & Sustainable Food</h2>
        <p>Support local restaurants, opt for plant-based meals, and avoid overfished seafood to reduce your environmental impact.</p>

        <h2>6. Respect Local Culture & Wildlife </h2>
        <p>Be mindful of cultural traditions, avoid unethical animal tourism, and stick to designated trails when exploring nature.</p>

        <h2>7. Support Local Businesses</h2>
        <p>Buy souvenirs from local artisans, use local tour guides, and stay in family-owned accommodations.</p>

        <h2>8. Offset Your Carbon Footprint</h2>
        <p>Contribute to tree-planting projects and carbon offset programs to balance out travel emissions.</p>
